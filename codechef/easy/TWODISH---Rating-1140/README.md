He needs one fruit and one vegetable to make the first type of dish and one vegetable and one fish to make the second type of dish. Now Chef has $A$ fruits, $B$ vegetables, and $C$ fishes in his house. Can he prepare at least $N$ dishes in total?

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers $N, A, B, C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print "YES" if Chef can prepare at least $N$ dishes, otherwise print "NO". Print the output without quotes.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, A, B, C \leq 100$
### Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints
### Sample 1:

```py
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N, A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if min(B, A + C) >= N:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
