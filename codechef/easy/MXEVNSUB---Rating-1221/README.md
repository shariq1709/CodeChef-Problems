## Problem

### Maximum Length Even Subarray

You are given an integer $N$. Consider the sequence containing the integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ in increasing order (each exactly once). Find the maximum length of its contiguous subsequence with an even sum.

### Input Format
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer --- the maximum length of a contiguous subsequence with even sum.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^4$

```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  The optimal choice is to choose the entire sequence, since the sum of all its elements is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, which is even.

 **Example case 3:**  One of the optimal choices is to choose the subsequence $[1, 2, 3, 4]$, which has an even sum.

```py
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    total_sum = (N * (N + 1)) // 2
    if total_sum % 2 == 0:
        print(N)
    else:
        print(N - 1)
```
