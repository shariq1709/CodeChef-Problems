## Problem

### Easy Pronunciation

 *Words that contain many consecutive consonants, like "`schtschurowskia`", are generally considered somewhat hard to pronounce.* 

We say that a word is  *hard to pronounce*  if it contains $4$ or more consonants in a row; otherwise it is  *easy to pronounce*. For example, "apple" and "polish" are easy to pronounce, but "schtschurowskia" is hard to pronounce.

You are given a string $S$ consisting of $N$ lowercase Latin characters. Determine whether it is easy to pronounce or not based on the rule above — print `YES` if it is easy to pronounce and `NO` otherwise.

For the purposes of this problem, the vowels are the characters $\{a, e, i, o, u\}$ and the consonants are the other $21$ characters.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the length of string $S$. The second line of each test case contains the string $S$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer — `YES` if $S$ is easy to pronounce, and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `YES`, `yeS`, `yes`, and `YeS` will all be treated as identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $S$ contains only lowercase Latin characters, i.e, the characters $\{a, b, c, \ldots, z\}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
5
apple
15
schtschurowskia
6
polish
5
tryst
3
cry
```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  "$\text{apple}$" doesn't have $4$ or move consecutive consonants, which makes it easy to pronounce.

 **Test case $2$:**  "$\text{\textcolor{red}{schtsch}urowskia}$" has $7$ consecutive consonants, which makes it hard to pronounce.

 **Test case $3$:**  $\text{polish}$ doesn't contain $4$ or more consecutive consonants, so it's easy to pronounce.

 **Test case $4$:**  $\text{\textcolor{red}{tryst}}$ contains $5$ consecutive consonants, making it hard to pronounce.

 **Test case $5$:**  $\text{cry}$ doesn't contain any vowels, but its length is less than $4$ so it's still easy to pronounce.

vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    
    consonant_count = 0
    is_hard = False
    
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            consonant_count = 0
        else:
            consonant_count += 1
            if consonant_count >= 4:
                is_hard = True
                break
    
    if is_hard:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
```
