## Problem

### Weight Balance

No play and eating all day makes your belly fat. This happened to Chef during the lockdown. His weight before the lockdown was $w_1$ kg (measured on the most accurate hospital machine) and after $M$ months of lockdown, when he measured his weight at home (on a regular scale, which can be inaccurate), he got the result that his weight was $w_2$ kg ($w_2 \gt w_1$).

Scientific research in all growing kids shows that their weights increase by a value between $x_1$ and $x_2$ kg (inclusive) per month, but not necessarily the same value each month. Chef assumes that he is a growing kid. Tell him whether his home scale could be giving correct results.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $w_1$, $w_2$, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $M$.
### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the integer $1$ if the result shown by the scale can be correct or $0$ if it cannot.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq w_1 \lt w_2 \leq 100$
- $0 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq 10$
- $1 \leq M \leq 10$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
5
1 2 1 2 2
2 4 1 2 2
4 8 1 2 2
5 8 1 2 2
1 100 1 2 2
```

```
0

0
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  Since the increase in Chef's weight is $2 - 1 = 1$ kg and that is less than the minimum possible increase $1 \cdot 2 = 2$ kg, the scale must be faulty.

 **Example case 2:**  Since the increase in Chef's weight is $4 - 2 = 2$ kg, which is equal to the minimum possible increase $1 \cdot 2 = 2$ kg, the scale is showing correct results.

 **Example case 3:**  Since the increase in Chef's weight is $8 - 4 = 4$ kg, which is equal to the maximum possible increase $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ kg, the scale is showing correct results.

 **Example case 4:**  Since the increase in Chef's weight $8 - 5 = 3$ kg lies in the interval $[1 \cdot 2, 2 \cdot 2]$ kg, the scale is showing correct results.

 **Example case 5:**  Since the increase in Chef's weight is $100 - 1 = 99$ kg and that is more than the maximum possible increase $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ kg, the weight balance must be faulty.

```py
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    w1, w2, x1, x2, M = map(int, input().split())
    diff = w2 - w1
    min_gain = x1 * M
    max_gain = x2 * M
    if min_gain <= diff <= max_gain:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
