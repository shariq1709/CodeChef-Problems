## Problem

### Distinct Pair Sums

You are given a range of integers $\{L, L+1, \ldots, R\}$. An integer $X$ is said to be  *reachable*  if it can be represented as a sum of two  **not necessarily distinct**  integers in this range. Find the number of distinct reachable integers.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.
### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of reachable integers.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq L \leq R \leq 10^6$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
2 2
2 3
```

```
1
3
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  The only reachable integer is $2 + 2 = 4$.

 **Example case 2:**  $4$, $5$ and $6$ are reachable, since $2+2=4$, $2+3=5$ and $3+3=6$.

```py
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    L, R = map(int, input().split())
    print(2 * (R - L) + 1)
```
