# JUMPCOST

## Problem

### Jumping Cost

You have an array $A$ of $N$ elements.

You are currently at index $1$ with a balance of $0$, and you can do the following jump operation as many times as you want:

- Choose to jump from index $i$ to index $j$ ($i < j$), and add $(A_j - j + i)$ to your balance.

Find the maximum possible balance you can have at any point using these jump operations.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum balance you can have.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 100$
- $-100 \le A_i \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
6
5 5 -1 5 -1 1
5
5 5 5 5 5
3
-4 -1 -5

```

```
7
16
0

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Optimal is to jump from index $1$ to $2$ and then to $4$.

 **Test Case 3:**  Optimal is to not take any jumps at all.

T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    max_bal = 0
    pos_sum = 0
    
    for j in range(1, N):
        current_bal = arr[j] - j + pos_sum
        
        if current_bal > max_bal:
            max_bal = current_bal
        if arr[j] > 0:
            pos_sum += arr[j]
            
    print(max_bal)
```
