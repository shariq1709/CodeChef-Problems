## Problem

### Make Distinct

You're given an array $A$ of length $N$, as well as an integer $K$.

You can perform the following operation on it:

- Choose at most $K$ distinct indices between $1$ and $N$.
- Increment the value at each chosen index by $1$.

Find the minimum number of operations of this type that you need to perform, to obtain an array $A$ where all the elements are pairwise distinct - i.e. $A_i \ne A_j$ must hold for $i \ne j$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of operations needed to obtain an array with pairwise distinct elements.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le K \le N$
- $1 \le A_i \le 2N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

7 4

```

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  $A = [2, 1]$ already contains pairwise distinct elements, so no operations are needed.

 **Test case $2$:**  $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$ initially, and we can increment at most $K = 2$ elements at once.
One sequence of $3$ operations is as follows:

- Increment the second and third elements. The array is now $[1, 2, 2, 1]$.
- Increment the second and fourth elements. The array is now $[1, 3, 2, 2]$.
- Increment the second and fourth elements again. The array is now $[1, 4, 2, 3]$. All the elements are now pairwise distinct.

for i in range(T):
    N,K=map(int,input().split())
    A=list(map(int,input().split()))
    B=set(A)
    len_set=len(B)
    len_arr=len(A)
    if len_set==len_arr:
        print(0)
    else:
        for i in range(0,len(A)+1):
            count=0
            if A[i]==A[i+1]:
                A[i+1]=A[i+1]+1
                count=count+1
        print(count)
        
```
